# You Who See My Tears - என் கண்ணீரைக் காண்கின்ற தேவா

This song of humble plea and awareness of life's vanity echoes Psalm 39 — David keeps silent in affliction, asks God to show him his end, and declares man’s fleeting nature. It is raw surrender — tears seen, prayers heard, hope in God alone. In the eternal day, this plea is answered perfectly — no more tears, no more vanity, only eternal life with the Lamb (Revelation 21:4).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who sees every tear and hears every prayer,
thank You for knowing our frailty and redeeming our fleeting days.
Be not silent — restore, forgive, show us our end in You.
In the eternal day, let us dwell in Your endless light.
Come quickly, our Hope and Redeemer.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
