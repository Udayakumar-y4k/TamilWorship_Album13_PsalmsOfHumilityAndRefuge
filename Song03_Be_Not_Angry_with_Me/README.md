# Be Not Angry with Me - என்மேல் கோபப்படாதீர்

This song of humble confession and plea for mercy echoes Psalm 38 — a lament of one overwhelmed by sin and affliction, crying “O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger.” It is raw honesty before God — acknowledging iniquity, asking for healing, trusting His compassion. In the eternal day, this plea is answered perfectly — no more sin or sorrow, only healing in His presence (Revelation 21:4).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, who bore our sins and healed our diseases,
thank You for hearing the cry of the broken and contrite.
Be not angry — forgive, heal, restore.
In the eternal day, let us stand whole before You.
Come quickly, our merciful Healer.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
