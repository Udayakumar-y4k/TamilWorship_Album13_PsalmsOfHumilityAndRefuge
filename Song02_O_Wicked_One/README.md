# O Wicked One - துன்மார்க்கனே துன்மார்க்கனே

This song of righteous warning and divine justice echoes Psalm 37 — the wicked plot against the righteous, sharpen swords, and build wealth, but the Lord laughs, cuts them off like smoke, and gives the land to the meek. It is a call to trust — the wicked fade, but those who wait on the Lord inherit forever. In the eternal day, this justice is perfected — the wicked no more, the righteous shine with the Lamb (Revelation 21:23–27).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, righteous Judge and Protector of the meek,
thank You for laughing at the wicked and upholding the righteous.
Let us wait on You, trust Your justice.
In the eternal day, let us inherit the land with You forever.
Come quickly, our Just King.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
